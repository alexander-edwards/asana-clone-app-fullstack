## 🐛 Identified Bugs and Issues

### Critical Issues:
1. **CORS Error with Backend API**

   - **Error**: "CORS Missing Allow Origin" when calling https://asana-backend-morphvm-s6un9i69.http.cloud.morph.so
   - **Impact**: Quick Demo Login hangs indefinitely
   - **Status**: Backend CORS configured but may need adjustment for production URL

### Major Issues:
2. **External URL Access Problem**
   - **Issue**: https://asana-frontend-morphvm-s6un9i69.http.cloud.morph.so returns blank page or 404

   - **Workaround**: Application works perfectly on localhost

3. **Icon Library Version Mismatch**
   - **Issue**: Heroicons v2 import paths were incorrect
   - **Fix Applied**: Updated all icon imports from @heroicons/react/outline to @heroicons/react/24/outline
   - **Status**: FIXED - All icons now render correctly

### Minor Issues:
4. **Vite Development Server Warnings**
   - **Issue**: WebSocket connection errors in console for hot module replacement
   - **Impact**: No functional impact, only affects development experience
   - **Status**: Normal for development environment
